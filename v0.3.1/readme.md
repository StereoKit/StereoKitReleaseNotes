## About

This project is set up to run in VR on Desktop on Windows and Linux. You can build and run it from source quite easily, but you can also find a pre-compiled portable binary in the [releases section](https://github.com/maluoi/StereoKitReleaseNotes/releases).

This is an interactive release notes demo project that showcases the new features in StereoKit v0.3.1! The code is here for you to peek at, but hasn't necessarily been thoroughly documented. Check the docs on [StereoKit.net](https://stereokit.net) for more detailed documentation and examples!

Check out the full (text based) release notes [over here](https://github.com/maluoi/StereoKit/releases/tag/v0.3.1).
